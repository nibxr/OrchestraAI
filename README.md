Architecture & Code Structure
1. Configuration & Setup
python
# Page configuration and API keys management
st.set_page_config(page_title="OrchestraAI", layout="wide")
AIRTABLE_API_KEY = "..."  # External database credentials
GEMINI_API_KEY = "..."    # AI model credentials
2. Resource Management
Cached Functions for performance optimization:

get_ai_models(): Initializes and caches AI models

get_airtable_data(): Retrieves and caches external data

get_embeddings(): Computes and caches text embeddings

3. Core AI Functions
Project Attribute Extraction
python
def extract_project_attributes(brief, gemini_model):
    # Uses structured prompting to extract JSON attributes
    # Handles parsing errors gracefully
Semantic Search Engine
python
def find_similar_items(query, df, embeddings, top_k=5):
    # Computes cosine similarity between query and database items
    # Returns top-k most relevant matches
Designer Expertise Analysis
python
def analyze_designer_expertise(deliverables_df):
    # Analyzes historical work patterns
    # Builds expertise profiles with specialization detection
4. Intelligence Layer
Complexity Assessment
Keyword-based scoring: Identifies complexity indicators (e-commerce, API, integration)

Weighted scoring system: Assigns complexity levels (Simple/Medium/Complex)

Smart Recommendations
Designer matching: Combines experience and specialization relevance

Project scoping: Context-aware scope generation using similar past projects

Question generation: Identifies information gaps for client clarification
